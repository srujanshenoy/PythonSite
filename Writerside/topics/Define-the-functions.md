# Define the functions

+ To create a calculator in python, we need to be able to
  + Get <control>valid</control> user input
    + This means getting it in the form of integers
    + this needs a prompt
  + Get the operator of the user
    + `+ - x /`: one of thse
  + Ask if they want to keep the calculation going

+ So,

```python
def intinput(prompt): pass
def opp_in(): pass
def continue_calc(): pass
```
